## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Tone of Voice
**Confident | Empowering | Client-Focused | Professional | Warm**

### Core Messaging Principles

#### 1. Always "You/Your" - Never "We/I"
**Why:** Clients care about their transformation, not our process

✅ **DO:** "Your story deserves to be seen"
❌ **DON'T:** "We create beautiful photography"

#### 2. Focus on Transformation, Not Service
**Why:** Clients buy outcomes, not features

✅ **DO:** "Imagery that elevates your brand presence"
❌ **DON'T:** "Professional photography services"

#### 3. Emphasize Audience Connection
**Why:** Clients care about reaching their ideal customers

✅ **DO:** "Connect with the audience you're meant to reach"
❌ **DON'T:** "High-quality professional images"

#### 4. Use Emotional Triggers
**Core words:** Authentic, Resonate, Connect, Elevate, Transform

✅ **DO:** "Create visual stories that resonate long after the shoot"
❌ **DON'T:** "Get professional photos for your business"

#### 5. Create Urgency Through Value
**Why:** Motivation through opportunity, not scarcity

✅ **DO:** "Your audience is waiting to connect with the authentic you"
❌ **DON'T:** "Limited spots available - book now!"

### Messaging Framework

- **Style:** Clarifying, emotional, audience-focused

**Examples:**
- "Powerful Imagery That Connects Your Brand with the Audience You're Meant to Reach"
- "When your visuals truly reflect who you are, your ideal audience feels it"

#### Call-to-Action Copy
- **Primary CTAs:** Action-oriented, benefit-focused
  - "Start Your Story"
  - "Discover Your Visual Impact"
  - "Transform Your Brand"
  
- **Secondary CTAs:** Exploratory, low-commitment
  - "See Our Work"
  - "Explore Our Approach"
  - "Learn More"

### Messaging Do's and Don'ts

✅ **DO:**
- Lead with client benefits
- Use second person ("you/your")
- Create emotional connection
- Focus on outcomes
- Be confident but not boastful
