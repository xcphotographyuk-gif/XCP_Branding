No cheese. Just truth.

BACK TO BUSINESS 📸

After months in the music documentary world (which I love), it's time to talk about what pays the bills—and transforms brands.

Your business deserves imagery that:
• Stops the scroll
• Tells your truth
• Converts browsers into buyers
• Stands out in a sea of stock photos

I don't do generic corporate headshots.
I don't do stiff, awkward poses.
I don't do "just smile at the camera."

I document the real you. The moments that show why your brand matters. The craft, the culture, the quiet rebellion that makes you different.

From artisan businesses to creative entrepreneurs, tech startups to hospitality legends—if you've got a story, I'll show it in a way that makes people feel it.

5 SIGNS
You Need New Brand Photos

(And why it's costing you clients)

→ Swipe to see if you're guilty
```

---

### Slide 2 - Sign #1
**Image Suggestion:** Screenshot of generic stock photo vs authentic brand image

**Text:**
```
SIGN #1:

Your photos look like
everyone else's industry.

If I can't tell it's YOUR business
from the imagery alone...
it's not working.
```

---

### Slide 3 - Sign #2
**Image Suggestion:** Old, outdated photo vs current, fresh imagery

**Text:**
```
SIGN #2:

Your "recent" photos
are from 2019.

Your business has evolved.
Your visuals haven't.

That's a trust issue.
```

---

### Slide 4 - Sign #3
**Image Suggestion:** Poorly lit, amateur photo vs professional quality

**Text:**
```
SIGN #3:

You're using iPhone photos
on your main marketing.

There's a time and place for
authentic iPhone content.

Your homepage isn't it.
```

---

### Slide 5 - Sign #4
**Image Suggestion:** Mix of inconsistent brand imagery

**Text:**
```
SIGN #4:

Every platform looks different.

Instagram: One vibe
Website: Another vibe
LinkedIn: WTF vibe

Consistency = Trust = Sales
```

---

### Slide 6 - The Solution + CTA
**Image Suggestion:** Your setup or compelling client result

**Text:**

Honest question: When's the last time you invested in your brand photography?

If you're still using iPhone photos from 2020, stock images that scream "generic business," or that one headshot from a cousin's wedding... we need to talk.

Your brand photos are doing one of two things:
1. Building trust and driving conversions
2. Actively turning potential clients away

There's no middle ground.

I've seen amazing businesses lose deals because their visuals didn't match their quality. Don't let that be you.

Swipe through these 5 signs. If 2 or more hit home, DM me "AUDIT" and I'll give you a free 10-minute brand photo assessment. No sales pitch. Just honest feedback on what's working and what's costing you business.

Let's get your visuals sorted. Your brand deserves better.

## Carousel 3: "The ROI of Professional Brand Photos"

**Slides:** 8 slides
**Goal:** Justify investment with data and logic
**CTA:** DM "INVEST" for package details

### Slide 1 - Cover
**Image Suggestion:** Split image showing investment → results

**Text:**
```
"£1,500 for photos?!"

Let me show you the math
that makes it obvious.

→ Swipe for the ROI breakdown
```

---

### Slide 2 - The Reality Check
**Image Suggestion:** Professional brand imagery in use across platforms

**Text:**
```
Your brand photos are working
24/7 for 1-2+ years.

That's £1,500 ÷ 730 days
= £2.05 per day

Would you pay £2/day for a
salesperson who never sleeps?
```

---

### Slide 3 - Website Impact
**Image Suggestion:** Website mockup showing professional imagery

**Text:**
```
WEBSITE CONVERSION:

Before professional photos:
• Average time: 15 seconds
• Bounce rate: 70%
• Inquiry rate: 1-2%

After professional photos:
• Average time: 2+ minutes
• Bounce rate: 40%
• Inquiry rate: 5-8%

That's 3-4× more leads.
```

---

### Slide 4 - Social Media Impact
**Image Suggestion:** Analytics showing engagement boost

**Text:**
```
SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT:

Generic content:
• 50-100 likes
• 2-5 comments
• 1-2% engagement

Professional brand content:
• 200-500+ likes
• 15-30+ comments
• 5-8% engagement

Better content = Better reach
= More clients
```

---

### Slide 5 - Real Client Example
**Image Suggestion:** Before/after of a client's business imagery impact

**Text:**
```
CASE STUDY:

Brighton café owner
Investment: £1,200

Results in 90 days:
• Instagram: +2,400 followers
• Website: +35% bookings
• New revenue: £8,500+

ROI: 708%

One photoshoot. Ongoing results.
```

---

### Slide 6 - The Hidden Costs of DIY
**Image Suggestion:** Stressed business owner with phone vs professional shoot

**Text:**
```
THE REAL COST OF "FREE":

DIY photos cost you:
• 10-15 hours of your time
• Inconsistent quality
• Lost credibility
• Missed sales

Your hourly rate × 15 hours
+ lost opportunities
= Way more than £1,500
```

---

### Slide 7 - What You're Really Buying
**Image Suggestion:** Collage of deliverables and usage scenarios

**Text:**
```
You're not buying "photos."

You're buying:
• Professional credibility
• Customer trust
• Marketing assets for 2+ years
• Content for every platform
• Competitive advantage
• Peace of mind

That's strategic business investment.
```

---

"That's expensive for photos."

I hear this. I get it. £1,500 feels like a lot when you're comparing it to iPhone photos that cost "nothing."

But here's the thing: those "free" photos are costing you way more than you think.

Every day, your brand imagery is either:
• Building trust → Driving conversions → Making you money
• Creating doubt → Losing clients → Costing you opportunities

The businesses crushing it right now? They invested in visuals that match their quality. The ones struggling often have amazing products/services... but imagery that screams "amateur hour."

I've watched £1,200 photoshoots generate £10k+ in new revenue within 60 days. Not because the photos are magic, but because professional imagery:
→ Builds instant credibility
→ Stops the scroll on social
→ Converts website visitors to clients
→ Works 24/7 for 1-2+ years

Swipe through for the real ROI breakdown. The math makes it obvious.
