## 3. SOCIAL MEDIA POST TEMPLATES

### Instagram Post Captions

**Template 1: Behind-the-Scenes**
```
The moment before the moment. ✨

[Client Name]'s brand shoot wasn't about perfect poses or forced smiles. 
It was about capturing the authentic energy that makes their audience 
stop scrolling and start connecting.

Your brand has that energy too. Let's show it to the world.

**Template 2: Client Transformation**
```
"I finally have photos that actually represent my brand." - [Client Name]

Before: Stock photos that felt generic and disconnected.
After: Authentic imagery that increased inquiries by 40% in the first month.

The difference? Strategic, intention-driven brand photography.

---

Your audience is scrolling past generic. They're stopping for authentic.

**Template 3: Education/Tips**
```
Why your DIY brand photos aren't converting (and what to do about it):

1️⃣ Inconsistent lighting = unprofessional appearance
2️⃣ No brand strategy = images don't tell your story
3️⃣ Wrong environment = disconnect from your audience
4️⃣ Uncomfortable poses = you look stiff, not authentic

Professional brand photography fixes all of this.

**Story 3: Quick Tip**
```
[Photo with text overlay]

BRAND PHOTOGRAPHY TIP:

Your photos should answer:
"Why should I care about this brand?"

Not:
"What does this person/product look like?"

## 4. LINKEDIN POST TEMPLATES

**Template 1: Thought Leadership**
```
Your brand photos are lying to your audience.

Not intentionally. But every stock photo, every rushed selfie, 
every "this will do for now" image is telling your ideal clients:

"This brand doesn't invest in how they're perceived."

And your audience makes judgments in 0.05 seconds.

Professional brand photography isn't vanity. It's strategy.

It's saying: "We care about how we show up. We're intentional. 
We're worth your attention."

What are your brand photos saying about you?

Comment "BRAND" and I'll send you my free Brand Photography Readiness Guide.

**Template 2: Client Success Story**
```
"Our website conversions increased 40% after updating our brand photography." 
- Sarah Mitchell, Founder @ Elevate Wellness

What changed?

BEFORE:
❌ Stock photos that felt generic
❌ Inconsistent imagery across platforms
❌ No connection to their actual brand values
❌ Visitors bounced within seconds

AFTER:
✅ Authentic imagery showing real team members
✅ Consistent visual brand across all channels
✅ Photography aligned with brand values
✅ Visitors stayed 3x longer, inquired more

The photography wasn't the only factor. But it was the catalyst 
that made everything else click.

Stock photos, selfies, and inconsistent imagery tell them:

### Email 2: Value (3 days later)
**Subject:** The #1 mistake I see in brand photography

**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

Quick question: When you look at your current brand photos, 
do you see someone trying to look professional...

Or do you see yourself authentically showing up for your ideal audience?

There's a huge difference.

The #1 mistake I see: Brands trying to look "professional" instead of 
trying to connect authentically.

Your audience doesn't want perfect. They want real.
