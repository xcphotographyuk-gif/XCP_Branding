# QUICK-START: Get Bookings THIS WEEK
## Priority Guide - Revenue from Photography Clients ASAP

**Goal:** Get paying photography clients booked within 7-14 days.

**Focus:** BOOKINGS FIRST. Passive income later.

---

## YOUR PRIORITY ORDER (Do These First)

### 🔥 CRITICAL PATH - Do These in Exact Order

This is the **minimum viable revenue system**. Everything else can wait.

---

## DAY 1: BOOKING FUNNEL (2-3 hours)

### Priority 1: Make Booking Incredibly Easy

**Check these exist on your site:**
- [ ] Clear "Book Now" or "Get Started" button on homepage (above fold)
- [ ] Contact form works (test it yourself)
- [ ] Phone number visible on every page
- [ ] Email address clickable everywhere
- [ ] Services page clearly shows packages & pricing

**If ANY are missing, fix them TODAY.**

---

### Priority 2: Remove Friction from Contact Form

**Your contact form should ask MINIMUM questions:**

**Essential fields ONLY:**
1. Name (required)
2. Email (required)
3. Phone (optional but recommended)
4. Type of shoot (dropdown: Brand, Portrait, Event, Other)
5. Preferred date (optional)
6. Message (required)

**That's it. 6 fields maximum.**

❌ **Remove these if they're on your form:**
- Budget field (discuss later)
- Long questionnaires
- Hair/makeup preferences
- "Ideal audience" essays
- Anything that takes >2 minutes to complete

**Why:** Every extra field = 10% fewer submissions. You can ask details AFTER they book a call.

---

### Priority 3: Set Up Booking Calendar (FREE)

**Use Calendly (FREE):**
1. Sign up: calendly.com/signup
2. Create event: "Free Discovery Call - 30 min"
3. Set availability (your actual available times)
4. Add to website: "Book Your Free Consultation" button
5. Link directly: `www.calendly.com/[your-username]/discovery-call`

**Add Calendly link to:**
- Homepage hero section
- Services page
- Contact page
- Email signature
- Social media bio

**This eliminates email back-and-forth.** Client clicks, picks time, booked.

---

## DAY 2: SOCIAL PROOF (1-2 hours)

### Priority 4: Get Testimonials Visible

**If you have past clients:**
- [ ] Email 3-5 best past clients
- [ ] Ask for 2-3 sentence testimonial
- [ ] Get permission to use their name + company
- [ ] Add to homepage (immediately below hero)
- [ ] Add to services page

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Quick favor? (2 minutes)

Hi [Name],

Quick ask: Would you mind sharing a 2-3 sentence testimonial about 
working together on your brand photography?

Specifically helpful:
- What made you choose to book?
- What was the result/impact of the photos?

If yes, just hit reply with your thoughts. I can polish it up if needed.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**If you DON'T have testimonials yet:**
- Remove testimonial section entirely (empty is worse than none)
- Add "Stats" instead: "100+ Sessions", "5+ Years", "50+ Brands"

---

### Priority 5: Portfolio Curation

**Only show your BEST 12-15 images.**

❌ Don't show:
- Everything you've ever shot
- 50+ images per gallery
- Mediocre work "filling space"

✅ Show:
- 12-15 absolute best images
- Mix of types (headshots, environmental, team, products)
- Images that look like what clients want

**Update your portfolio page TODAY if it's not curated.**

---

## DAY 3: LEAD MAGNETS (2 hours)

### Priority 6: Create "Free Consultation" Offer

**On every page, offer:**
```
Free 30-Minute Brand Photography Consultation

Discover:
✓ Which package fits your brand goals
✓ How to prepare for amazing results
✓ Exactly what to expect from the process

No obligation. No pressure. Pure value.

[Book Your Free Call]
```

**This converts 3-5× better than "Contact Me"**

---

### Priority 7: Download Lead Magnet (Optional but Powerful)

**Create simple 1-page PDF:**
- "Brand Photography Session Prep Checklist"
- Use the content from `BLOG_10_Brand_Photo_Prep_Tips.md`
- Design in Canva (free)
- Offer as download in exchange for email

**Add popup:**
"Download: How to Prepare for Amazing Brand Photos (FREE)"

**This captures emails even if they don't book immediately.**

---

**List to email:**
- [ ] Past clients (even from years ago)

### Day 12-14: Optimize & Repeat

**Double down on what works:**
- If warm emails converted: Send 50 more

---

## PASSIVE INCOME (Do AFTER You Have Bookings)

**Once you have 2-3 bookings secured:**

### Week 3-4: Affiliate Content
- [ ] Publish `BLOG_M43_Music_Photography_Gear.md`

- [ ] Share in photography communities

### Week 4-5: Shop Setup
- [ ] Install WooCommerce

- [ ] Create 5 products
- [ ] Announce to email list

**But NOT before you have booking revenue flowing.**

**Don't spend time on these until you have 5+ bookings:**
- ❌ Gift guides
- ❌ Home studio setup posts
- ❌ Workshops
- ❌ Digital products
- ❌ Full e-commerce shop
- ❌ Complex email sequences
- ❌ Print brochures

**These are great for passive income, but they don't get clients booked THIS WEEK.**

## MOST COMMON MISTAKES

**Don't do these:**
- ❌ Spending weeks setting up perfect shop before getting clients
- ❌ Writing 20 blog posts before doing outreach
- ❌ Perfecting website before talking to prospects
- ❌ Waiting for "everything to be ready"
- ❌ Focusing on passive income before active bookings

**Do these instead:**

- ✅ Get on calls and close deals
- ✅ Deliver amazing work, get referrals

**Bookings first. Everything else second.**

Book by Friday, save £200 on Brand Foundation package.

**Offer package at £500-600 to close FAST.**

**This can generate £1,500-£1,800 in 48 hours.**

---

## WHEN TO ADD PASSIVE INCOME

- You have 3-4 hours/week free time
- Your booking pipeline is consistent

**Add shop when:**
- You have 10+ bookings secured

**Don't sacrifice booking revenue for passive income potential.**

---

## REALITY CHECK

**Photography services revenue:**
- £800-£3,500 per client
- Close in 1-2 weeks
- Predictable income

**Affiliate revenue:**
- £5-£50 per referral
- Takes 3-6 months to rank
- Unpredictable income

**Shop revenue:**
- £15-£200 per product
- Requires traffic and time
- Supplemental income

**Focus on the £800-£3,500 first. Then add the rest.**
