# Instagram Carousel Templates for XC Photography
## Build Your Tribe Inspired Content Strategy

**Purpose:** 10 ready-to-use carousel templates with slide-by-slide content, hooks, and CTAs. Inspired by Brock Johnson's "Build Your Tribe" Instagram growth methodology for photographers.

**Why Carousels Work:**
- 2-3× more engagement than single images
- Instagram algorithm favors them (more time on post)
- Swipeable = interactive = better reach
- Educational content builds trust
- Perfect for service-based businesses

**How to Use:**
1. Choose a carousel topic below
2. Create 9-10 slides using Canva/Adobe Express
3. Follow the content and design guidance for each slide
4. Use your brand colors (teal #2DD4BF, charcoal #1F2937)
5. Post and watch engagement grow

## Build Your Tribe Method (Brock Johnson)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Value First** - Educate before you sell
2. **Storytelling** - Make every post a mini-story
3. **Strong Hooks** - First slide must stop the scroll
4. **Clear CTAs** - Always tell them what to do next
5. **Consistency** - Show up regularly

**Carousel Strategy:**
- 70% Educational/valuable
- 20% Behind-the-scenes/personal
- 10% Promotional/sales

**Your carousel mix should be:**
- 7 educational (Myths, Tips, How-Tos)
- 2 personal (Meet Me, BTS)
- 1 promotional (Limited Availability)

**This builds trust, then converts.**
