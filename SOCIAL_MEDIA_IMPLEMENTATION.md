**POST TEMPLATE 1: Behind-the-Scenes**

```
[Insert photo of you on a shoot]

This is what I love about brand photography:

It's not just about perfect lighting or composition (though those matter).

It's about capturing the REAL energy of a business. The moments when your team forgets the camera is there and just... works together.

That's when magic happens.

Last week with [Client/Industry], we focused on showing their collaborative culture. Not staged. Not forced. Just authentic.

Your ideal clients can feel that authenticity a mile away.

📸 What do you want your visual story to communicate?

#BrandPhotography #AuthenticBusiness #ProfessionalImagery #[YourCity]Business
```

**POST TEMPLATE 2: Client Transformation**

```
[Before/After comparison OR client photo]

From stock photos to a custom brand library in one afternoon.

[Client Name], a [Industry] business in [City], came to us with a common challenge: their website and marketing materials didn't feel like THEM.

The result?
✅ 50+ images showcasing their real team, real space, real energy
✅ Cohesive brand imagery across website, LinkedIn, and proposals
✅ Increased engagement on their content
✅ More confident when networking (they actually show their photos!)

"The photography transformed how we show up. We finally LOOK like the professionals we are." - [Client Name]

Your visual story matters more than you think.

[Tag client if they're on LinkedIn]

#ClientSuccess #BrandPhotography #BusinessGrowth
```

**POST TEMPLATE 3: Educational/Value**

```
3 reasons your team photos should be updated EVERY year:

1️⃣ Your team changes
New hires. Promotions. Growth. Your photos should reflect who you ARE, not who you were in 2019.

2️⃣ Your brand evolves
Your business isn't static. Why should your imagery be?

3️⃣ Authenticity builds trust
Current photos = "This business is active and thriving."
Outdated photos = "Are they still in business?"

Your ideal clients notice. They make snap judgments based on your imagery.

When did you last update your team photos?

#BrandPhotography #BusinessTip #ProfessionalImagery #[YourCity]
```

**POST TEMPLATE 4: Behind the Shot**

```
[Striking portfolio image]

Sometimes the best shots are the unplanned ones.

We were wrapping up [Client]'s brand session when the afternoon light hit the window just right. I asked everyone to pause for 30 seconds.

This wasn't on the shot list. This wasn't planned.

But THIS is the image they use everywhere now.

Brand photography isn't about following a script. It's about being present and catching the moments that matter.

What's your favorite "unplanned moment" story?

#BrandPhotography #BehindTheScenes #PhotographyLife
```

**POST TEMPLATE 5: Industry Insight**

```
Hot take: Stock photos are killing your brand.

I get it. Stock photos are:
✅ Easy
✅ Professional-looking
✅ Ready to use

But they're also:
❌ Generic
❌ Used by 1,000+ other businesses
❌ Completely disconnected from YOUR story

Your ideal clients are choosing between you and your competitors.

When you both use the same stock photo library, how do they choose?

Custom brand photography isn't an expense. It's differentiation.

Thoughts?

I noticed we're both in [Industry/Location] and I love the work you're doing with [Something specific from their profile].

I work with businesses on authentic brand photography - would love to connect and follow your journey.

Best,

```

**After They Accept:**
- Thank them
- Don't immediately pitch
- Engage with their content
- After 2-3 weeks, if they're a good fit, soft intro:

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question - have you updated your brand photography recently?

I work with [their industry] businesses on creating authentic visual libraries that actually represent their brand (not stock photos or selfies).

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to chat about how professional imagery could support your goals?

Either way, great connecting with you.

**CAPTION 1: Storytelling**
```
[Client name]'s reaction when they saw their photos:

"Oh wow. That's... that's actually me."

That's what I love about this work.

It's not about making you look different. It's about showing you as you ACTUALLY are - at your best, authentically.

[Client] needed imagery for their new website. Stock photos felt generic. Selfies felt unprofessional.

Professional brand photography? That felt RIGHT.

Your ideal clients can tell the difference.

**CAPTION 2: Educational**
```
Quick tip: Don't smile in ALL your brand photos.

Hear me out.

A variety of expressions shows different sides of your brand:

• Smiling = Approachable, friendly, welcoming
• Thoughtful = Expert, strategic, considered
• Serious = Professional, trustworthy, capable
• Laughing = Authentic, human, relatable

Your brand isn't one-dimensional. Your photos shouldn't be either.

Save this for your next brand session 📸

What expression do you use most in your current photos?

#brandphotographytips #businessphotos #professionalimages
```

**CAPTION 3: Behind-the-Scenes**
```
[Behind-the-scenes photo]

People ask: "How do you get people to look natural in photos?"

The secret: I don't.

I let them BE natural.

No fake poses. No forced smiles. Just conversation and genuine moments.

The best photos happen when people forget they're being photographed.

That's the goal every session.

## PART 3: FACEBOOK STRATEGY

### A. Business Page Setup

1. **Page Name:** XC Photography
2. **Category:** Photographer
3. **Bio:** Same as Instagram
4. **Profile Photo:** Logo or headshot

### C. Facebook Groups Strategy

**Join Local Business Groups:**

**How to Find:**

- "[Your City] Small Business Owners"
- "[Your Industry] Professionals"

**Rules for Groups:**
1. **Don't spam** - provide value first
2. Answer questions about marketing/branding
3. Share helpful content (not every post is a pitch)
4. Engage genuinely for 2 weeks before mentioning services
5. When someone asks about photography, DM them

**Value-Add Post in Groups:**
```
Quick tip for anyone updating their website this year:

Stock photos vs. Custom brand photography:

Stock photos:
- Generic (everyone uses them)
- Disconnected from your brand
- Clients can tell

Custom photography:
- Shows YOUR team, YOUR space
- Authentic connection
- Differentiation from competitors

If you're serious about standing out, invest in imagery that's actually yours.

Happy to chat if anyone's considering a brand photography session this year! 📸

## PART 4: BEHANCE STRATEGY

### A. Why Behance Matters

**Behance is for:**
- Portfolio showcase
- Creative community connection
- SEO (ranks in Google)
- Professional credibility
- Attracting creative industry clients

**NOT for:**
- Frequent posting (quarterly is fine)
- Direct client acquisition (mostly portfolio)
- Social engagement (low activity platform)

### B. Behance Best Practices

**1. Create a Professional Profile**

**Profile Photo:** Professional headshot
**Cover Image:** Best portfolio work
**Bio:**
```
Brand & Documentary Photographer specializing in authentic visual storytelling for businesses and creative professionals.

Website: www.xcphotography.co
Instagram: @xcphotography
Email: your@email.com
```

**Fields:**
- Brand Strategy
- Photography

**2. Create Projects (Not Individual Photos)**

**Each "Project" = One Client or Theme**

[Client outcome - e.g., "New imagery across website, social media, and proposals. 40% increase in consultation bookings."]

Camera: [Your gear]
Location: [City/Venue]
Client: [Industry]

```

**Images:**
- 10-20 images per project

- High resolution (at least 1920px wide)
- Consistent editing style
- Tell a story with the sequence

**Tags:**
- brand photography
- [your city] photographer

- Day-in-the-life style shoots

**Collection 3: "Portraits & Headshots"**

**Focus on quality over quantity.**

**5. Engagement Strategy**

**Weekly (15 Minutes):**

**7. Link to Your Site**

**Every project should include:**

- Link to specific services page if relevant

**8. Showcase Process**

**Behance loves process:**

**Example Project Flow:**
1. Mood board/inspiration
2. Behind-the-scenes setup shot

- Quote from client
- Client name + company
- Add to end of project

**10. Behance Analytics**

**Check monthly:**
