## The Difference Between "Good Photos" and "Photos That Transform Your Brand"? Preparation.

I've photographed over 200 brand sessions. The clients who get the best results aren't the most photogenic—they're the most prepared.

Last month, two clients booked the same package. Same photographer (me), same location, similar businesses.

**Client A:** Showed up with whatever was clean. Didn't think about it.  
**Client B:** Followed this 10-step prep checklist.

**Result:**  
Client A got decent photos. Used a few on their website.  
Client B got transformative imagery. Inquiries increased 40% in the first month.

**The difference? These 10 things.**

## 1. Choose Clothing That Reflects Your Brand, Not Fashion Trends

**The mistake:** Wearing what looks good in general.  
**The fix:** Wear what aligns with your brand positioning.

### Clothing Strategy by Brand Type:

**Corporate/Professional:**
- ✅ Structured blazers, button-up shirts
- ✅ Neutral colors (navy, charcoal, white, grey)
- ✅ Minimal patterns (solid colors or subtle pinstripes)
- ❌ Busy patterns, loud colors, casual t-shirts

**Creative/Approachable:**
- ✅ Soft fabrics (cashmere, cotton blends)
- ✅ Layering (cardigans, open blazers, scarves)
- ✅ Earthy tones or brand colors
- ❌ Too formal, overly structured pieces

**Edgy/Bold:**
- ✅ Leather, denim, statement pieces
- ✅ Black, deep jewel tones
- ✅ Textured fabrics
- ❌ Pastel colors, overly feminine/masculine styles

**Wellness/Organic:**
- ✅ Natural fabrics (linen, organic cotton)
- ✅ Soft, flowing silhouettes
- ✅ Neutral earth tones
- ❌ Synthetics, harsh lines, corporate styles

---

### Universal Clothing Rules:

**DO:**
- Bring 3-5 outfit options (we'll choose on shoot day)
- Choose solid colors over busy patterns
- Wear clothes that fit well (not too tight, not too loose)
- Layer pieces (jacket, cardigan) for variety
- Consider your brand colors
- Iron or steam everything

**DON'T:**
- Wear logos or branded clothing (unless it's YOUR brand)
- Choose trendy pieces that'll date photos quickly
- Wear all black (hard to photograph, looks harsh)
- Wear white (can blow out in bright light)
- Buy new clothes the day before (they won't feel natural)

---

### The "Touch Test"
Run your hand across the fabric. If it feels cheap or scratchy, it'll photograph that way.

**Invest in:**
- Quality fabrics (cotton, wool, linen, cashmere)
- Proper tailoring
- Classic cuts that won't date quickly

**UK Shopping Recommendations:**
- **Professional:** M&S Autograph, Reiss, Jigsaw
- **Creative:** COS, & Other Stories, Arket
- **Accessible:** Uniqlo, Zara, ASOS (choose carefully)

---

## 2. Plan Hair & Makeup (Even If You Don't Usually Wear Makeup)

**The truth:** Camera + professional lighting = washed out without makeup.

This isn't about looking "dolled up." It's about looking like yourself—but polished.

### For Women:

**Minimum:**
- Foundation/BB cream (even skin tone)
- Concealer (under eyes, blemishes)
- Powder (controls shine)
- Mascara (defines eyes)
- Lip color (photos wash out natural lip color)

**Better:**
- Add: Blush (adds dimension), eyebrow definition, eyeliner

**Professional:**
- Hire professional makeup artist (£80-150)
- Specializes in photography makeup (not stage/evening makeup)
- Natural, camera-ready finish

---

### For Men:

**Yes, you too need this:**
- Mattifying powder or primer (controls shine)
- Concealer for dark circles (minimal, natural)
- Lip balm (prevents chapped lips)
- Tinted moisturizer (optional, evens skin tone)

**Or:** Hire makeup artist (they know how to make it look natural)

---

### Hair:

**Do:**
- Get haircut 7-10 days before shoot (not day before—too fresh)
- Plan hairstyle that reflects how you normally look
- Bring hair ties, clips, styling tools
- Consider professional styling (£40-80)

**Don't:**
- Try a new hairstyle the day of shoot
- Over-style with heavy products (photographs badly)
- Ignore grey roots or grown-out color

---

## 3. Prepare Your Skin (Starting 2 Weeks Before)

**Two weeks out:**
- Increase water intake (hydrated skin photographs better)
- Avoid new skincare products (risk of breakouts)
- Get facials/treatments NOW (not 3 days before)
- SPF daily (prevents uneven skin tone)

**One week out:**
- Exfoliate regularly (smooth, even skin)
- Moisturize morning & night
- Get extra sleep (reduces dark circles)

**48 hours before:**
- No alcohol (causes puffiness, redness)
- Reduce salt intake (prevents bloating)
- Drink extra water

**Day before:**
- Early night (8+ hours sleep)
- Light, healthy meals
- No new products on face

**Day of:**
- Arrive with clean, moisturized skin
- No heavy creams (makeup won't stick)
- Bring oil-blotting sheets for shine

## What Happens When You Skip Preparation?

**Real examples from my shoots:**

**Client showed up unprepared:**
- Wrinkled clothing (had to steam on-site, wasted 30 minutes)
- Didn't sleep well (visible dark circles, tired eyes)
- Forgot props (missed opportunity for brand storytelling)
- Stiff, uncomfortable (showed in every photo)
- Result: Mediocre photos, disappointed client

**Client followed this checklist:**
- Multiple outfit options (chose best on camera)
- Well-rested, energized (vibrant, confident photos)
- Brought brand elements (told compelling story)
- Clear on their message (authentic, powerful imagery)
- Result: Transformative photos, 40% inquiry increase

**The difference was preparation, not photogenic-ness.**

## For Photography Clients: Why This Matters

You're not paying for "nice photos." You're investing in imagery that transforms how your audience perceives your brand.

**But even the best photographer can't make up for:**
- Wrinkled clothing
- Poor skin prep
- Wrong outfit choices
- Unprepared mindset
- Cluttered locations

**Your preparation = photographer's ability to deliver results.**
