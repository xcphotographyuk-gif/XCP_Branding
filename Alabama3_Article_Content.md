## ARTICLE CONTENT

### Opening Paragraph (Intro)
It isn't often that a free ticket turns out to be the gateway to an incredible gig. The atmosphere was fantastic and lively, perfect for the venue which was packed with an excited crowd. The perfect size - intimate but large enough to show the scope of the band. The opening act was a wonderful choice that fit the unique character of Alabama 3 incredibly well. But more than anything else, the rare realisation that you're surrounded by actual fans was what gave rise to the mind-blowing energy of the whole joyful experience. Everyone was dancing with few exceptions giving a very communal feel to the gig.

### Main Article Body

The opening act was a Fleetwood Mac inspired band, The Dead Reds, who announced their upcoming album launch at the Hope & Ruin, with an unexpected mix of country and punk lyrics which complemented Alabama 3's interesting fusion of techno acid house country. They had amazing energy and enthusiasm with a great stage presence. The whole band had well-coordinated outfits that fit well with the genre with long flowing sleeves and 70s silhouettes that gave the performance a professional feel and it was a great addition that showed thought and effort.

Alabama 3 started their set with only a small break after the opener. This was fantastic and made the night flow very nicely. The band had such liveliness which was exemplified by their ability to talk between songs they had great comedic banter and matched the audience's energy expertly. The chosen song order felt thoughtful and worked well building up energy with the songs played at the start being slower and leaning into the more country aspects of acid house techno country fusion that transitions into the most frantic and fast-paced songs with the techno elements at the forefront.

One criticism I have however is the choice to play three songs as an encore this left the crowd separated and unsure when to leave, ending in people walking in and out because of the uncertainty. Another element I was excited to see was the matching outfits; they were a perfect mix of consideration and effort alongside fun and silliness. They all had gold suits that looked incredible with the lighting changes pulling focus to the stage at all times even when the songs were slower paced and the band stood still it maintained visual excitement.

An aspect of the performance I was surprised by was the choreography. It brought a great feeling and enthusiasm, lighting up the audience and energising them. It also gave me the impression that Alabama 3 cared about the details and wanted to put on a show not just perform their songs. Overall, it was an incredible show. I encourage anyone who has the opportunity to see Alabama 3 live. They had some of the most interesting and unique music I've ever heard and were some of the best performers I've seen.

## ARTIST INFORMATION

### Alabama 3

South London's beloved roots-futurists ALABAMA 3 have announced 'STEP 13: THE DIVINE INTERVENTION TOUR' set to take place in Spring 2025. The group was born at an all-night squat party during the '90s. Charismatic front man and co-founder Rob Spragg, started singing the lyrics to a Hank Williams song over an acid-house beat. Meanwhile, the other co-founder, the late Jake Black, a diehard Jazz fan, apparently re-joined with some bebop skat stylings. On that unforgettable night, the mutant embryo of the ALABAMA 3 was conceived.

Still adored the world over for 1997's inaugural smash 'Woke Up This Morning', whose marriage of Howlin' Wolf samples and trip hop beats provided the theme music for long-running HBO series 'The Sopranos', Alabama 3 have continued to explore their uniquely British absurdist twist on Americana, riven by post-rave aesthetics, savage socio-political satire, and lowlife narcotic misadventure.
