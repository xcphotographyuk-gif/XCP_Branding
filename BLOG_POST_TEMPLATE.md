## Post Structure

### 2. Opening Hook (100-150 words)

**Example:**
```
Your audience scrolls past hundreds of images every day. But when they see 
*that* shot—the one that stops them mid-scroll—something changes. They feel 
it. They remember it. They choose you because of it.

The difference between forgettable and unforgettable isn't talent or luck. 
It's the right gear in the right hands, used with intention. Let me show you 
exactly what makes the difference.
