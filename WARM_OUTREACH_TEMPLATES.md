# Warm Outreach Templates - XCP Brand Voice
## For People Who Hate "Selling" (Non-Sales-y Approach)

**Your situation:** You have booking form + CTAs on site. You just need to reach out to people authentically.

**Your challenge:** Low confidence, don't want to sound sales-y, need to match your brand voice.

**Solution:** These templates feel like genuine connection, not selling.

---

## MINDSET SHIFT (Read This First)

**You're NOT selling. You're:**
- Letting people know you have availability
- Offering to help solve a problem they might have
- Starting conversations with people you care about
- Sharing something valuable

**XCP Brand Voice:**
- Authentic over polished
- Helpful over pushy
- Personal over corporate
- Story-driven over feature-driven
- "I noticed..." over "I'm offering..."

---

## OPTION 1: NEWSLETTER APPROACH (Lowest Pressure)

### Why This Works for You:
- One message reaches many people
- Feels less "sales-y" than individual emails
- Educational/valuable content first, offer second
- People opt-in by reading, no pressure to respond

### Monthly Newsletter Template

**Subject:** [Month] Update: What I'm Working On

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick update from behind the camera this month.

I've been shooting [type of work - e.g., "brand photography for local 
startups" or "team headshots for growing businesses"]. 

One thing I'm noticing: A lot of businesses have photos that don't really 
reflect who they are anymore. Stock photos. Outdated headshots. Images 
that feel... generic.

Your brand deserves better than generic.

If you've been thinking about updating your visual presence (or know 
someone who should), I have a few spots available in [Month].

Here's what's included:
• [Your main package - e.g., "Half-day brand photography session"]
• [Deliverables - e.g., "50+ professionally edited images"]
• [Benefit - e.g., "Images that actually represent your brand"]

Starting at £[price].

Not ready yet? No worries. I'll keep sharing stories and insights from 
shoots each month.

Keep creating,
[Your Name]

P.S. - What's one thing you wish you had professional photos of? Hit reply 
and let me know. I'm always curious what businesses actually need.
```

**Why this works:**
- Starts with value (observation/insight)
- Offer is embedded naturally
- "Not ready? No worries" removes pressure
- P.S. invites conversation, not sale
- Sounds like you, not a marketing template

---

### Quarterly Newsletter (More Substantial)

**Subject:** What [Season] Taught Me About [Photography Topic]

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

[Season] has been... interesting behind the camera.

I've photographed [specific example - "three different startups in the same 
industry, each trying to look 'professional'"].

Here's what I learned: Professional doesn't mean stiff.

The businesses that really connect with their audience? They look like 
themselves. Not like they're trying to be someone else.

Your photos should feel like you, just... captured well.

---

**If you're thinking about brand photography:**

I have [number] spots available in [Month/Quarter].

What you get:
• Pre-shoot strategy (we figure out what you actually need)
• [Duration] photography session
• [Number] professionally edited images
• Usage rights for everything (website, social, print—use them everywhere)

Investment starts at £[price].

**Not ready to book?**

That's completely fine. Here are three things you can do right now to 
improve your brand imagery:

1. [Tip 1 - e.g., "Curate your best 10 images and delete the rest"]
2. [Tip 2 - e.g., "Use consistent lighting across all your photos"]
3. [Tip 3 - e.g., "Show your face—people connect with people"]

Worth it,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I'm always curious: What's your biggest frustration with brand 
photography? Reply and tell me. I read every response.
```

**Why this works:**
- Story-driven (your brand voice)
- Educational first, offer second
- "Not ready? Here's free value anyway"
- Invitation to conversation
- Shows expertise without bragging

---

## OPTION 2: WARM EMAIL OUTREACH (Individual, Personal)

### For Past Clients

**Subject:** Checking in

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Been thinking about our shoot together [timeframe - "last year" / "back in 
2023"].

How are those photos working for you? Still using them?

I was looking through my archive and came across [specific image from 
their shoot]. Still one of my favorites.

If you ever need updated images (teams change, brands evolve, styles 
shift), let me know. I have a few spots in [Month].

Either way, hope you're doing well.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Genuine check-in, not sales pitch
- Personal detail (specific image)
- Offer is casual mention, not hard sell
- Can reply "thanks, we're good" with zero awkwardness

---

### For Business Connections (Not Past Clients)

**Subject:** Quick thought about [Their Business]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I was on your website today (looking at [specific thing - their about page, 
services, etc.]) and noticed your team photos look a bit outdated.

Not trying to sell you anything—just genuinely curious: Are you happy with 
how your brand shows up visually?

I ask because I work with a lot of [their industry] businesses and the ones 
that really connect with clients? They show up as themselves. Authentically. 
Not trying to look "professional" in that stiff corporate way.

If you ever want to chat about it, I'm happy to share what I've seen work 
(and what doesn't). No obligation.

Free 15-minute call: [Calendly link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Starts with noticing something specific (shows you care)
- "Not trying to sell" disarms immediately
- Asks question instead of pitching
- Offers value (share what works) not service
- Ultra-low commitment (15 min, not 30)

---

### For LinkedIn Connections

**Subject:** Thought of you

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw your recent post about [something they shared - hiring, growth, new 
office, etc.] and thought of you.

[Specific observation - "Growing teams often realize their website photos 
don't reflect who they are anymore" OR "New offices are great, but only if 
people can see them"]

If you ever want to update your brand imagery, I'd love to help. I work with 
[type of businesses] to create photos that actually represent who they are.

Not ready yet? No worries. Just wanted you to know I'm here.

Portfolio: [Link]

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Triggered by something they shared (relevant)
- Specific observation shows you're paying attention
- "Not ready? No worries" removes all pressure
- Feels like helpful suggestion from connection, not cold pitch

---

## OPTION 3: LINKEDIN CHAT STARTERS (Lowest Barrier)

### After They Post About Business Update

**Message:**
```
Love that you're [what they posted about - expanding, hiring, new service]. 

Question: Do your current brand photos reflect this new direction? Or are 
they from the "before" era?

Asking because I see this a lot—businesses evolve but their imagery doesn't.
```

**Then if they engage:**
```
If you ever want to update them, I'd be happy to chat. No pressure—just 
letting you know I'm here.

[Calendly link]
```

---

### After Connecting (New LinkedIn Connection)

**Message:**
```
Thanks for connecting!

Quick question (out of genuine curiosity): When was the last time you updated 
your professional headshot?

I'm a brand photographer and I notice a lot of professionals have photos 
from... years ago. Pre-pandemic hair. Different company. Different vibe.

If you've been thinking about updating yours, happy to chat about what makes 
a great headshot. (Spoiler: It's not about looking "professional"—it's about 
looking like YOU.)
```

---

### For Someone You Haven't Talked To In A While

**Message:**
```
Hey [Name]! Been a minute.

Random question: Do you ever need brand photography for [their business]?

I just opened up some availability and thought of you. No pressure if not—
just wanted to reach out.

How have you been?
```

**Why these work:**
- Question-based (invites conversation)
- Curious tone, not sales-y
- Personal, not corporate
- Easy to say "not right now" without awkwardness

---

## OPTION 4: SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS (Passive Outreach)

### Instagram/Facebook Post (Availability Announcement)

**Caption:**
```
Taking on 3 new brand photography clients in [Month]. ✨

If you've been thinking about:
• Updating your team photos
• Finally getting professional headshots
• Creating content for your website/social
• Showing up as yourself (not stock photos)

Now's the time.

Investment starts at £800 for half-day sessions.

Book a free call: Link in bio
DM me to chat
Or visit: [website]

P.S. - Not ready yet? That's totally fine. I'll be here when you are.
```

---

### LinkedIn Post (Thought Leadership)

**Post:**
```
Unpopular opinion: You don't need a professional photographer.

You need someone who understands your brand, listens to your goals, and 
creates imagery that actually represents who you are.

The camera is the easy part.

The strategy? The understanding? The "I get what you're trying to do here"? 
That's what makes the difference.

If you're looking for brand photography that goes beyond "smile and look 
professional," let's talk.

[Calendly link in comments]
```

## SCRIPTS FOR LOW CONFIDENCE MOMENTS

### When You Feel Awkward Reaching Out:

**Remind yourself:**
- "I'm not selling. I'm letting someone know I can help."
- "The worst they can say is 'not right now.'"
- "People who need this will be grateful I reached out."
- "I'd want someone to tell me if they could help with something I need."

---

### Opening Line That Feels Natural:

```
"Not sure if this is on your radar, but I have some photography 
availability in [Month] and thought of you."
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges it might not be relevant ("not sure if...")
- Personal ("thought of you")
- Information, not sales pitch
- Easy to decline

---

### If They Say "Not Right Now":

```
"No worries at all! If anything changes or you know someone who needs 
photos, feel free to send them my way. Either way, hope you're doing well!"
```

**Then move on. No awkwardness.**

---

## CONVERSATION OPENERS (Not Pitches)

### General Icebreaker:

```
"Quick question—when you think about brand photography, what's the first 
thing that comes to mind?"
```

**Then listen.** Their answer tells you if they're a fit.

---

### For Someone Who Might Need It:

```
"I noticed [observation about their business]. Are you happy with how your 
brand shows up visually, or is that something you've been meaning to update?"
```

**Then shut up and listen.**

---

### After They Express Interest:

```
"Want to jump on a quick call and I can share what I'm thinking? Zero 
pressure—just want to make sure it's actually a good fit before we commit 
to anything."
```

---

## EMAIL SIGNATURES (Passive CTA)

## OBJECTION HANDLERS (When They're Hesitant)

### "I don't know if we need professional photos"

**Your response:**
```
"Totally fair. Here's a quick test: Do your current photos make people 
want to work with you? Or do they just... exist?

If they're doing their job, you probably don't need new ones. But if 
you've ever thought 'these don't really represent us anymore,' that's 
usually a sign."
```

---

### "We don't have budget right now"

**Your response:**
```
"I get it. If budget's tight, here are three things you can do right now 
for free: [give actual helpful tips].

When budget opens up and you want professional imagery, I'm here. No 
pressure."
```

---

### "I hate being photographed"

**Your response:**
```
"You're not alone—literally everyone says that. The difference between 
awkward photos and great photos? The photographer making you forget 
there's a camera.

My sessions don't feel like photoshoots. They feel like conversations. 
You talk, I capture. That's it."
```

---

## THE "I'M NOT GOOD AT EMAILS" STRATEGY

### Send This Exact Email:

**Subject:** Quick question

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: Have you updated your brand photos in the last couple years?

If not (and if it's been on your mind), I have some availability in [Month].

Let me know if you want to chat about it.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Calendly link]
```

**That's it. 4 sentences. Not sales-y. Just asking.**

---

## NEWSLETTER VS. INDIVIDUAL EMAILS

### Start With Newsletter If:
- You have 50+ contacts
- You're uncomfortable with individual outreach
- You want to share value regularly
- You don't need immediate bookings

**Tool:** MailerLite (free up to 1,000 subscribers)

---

### Do Individual Emails If:
- You have 10-30 warm contacts
- You need bookings THIS MONTH
- You can customize messages
- You're willing to be slightly uncomfortable

**Hybrid approach:** Newsletter monthly + individual emails to hottest leads

---

## LINKEDIN STRATEGY (Low Confidence Friendly)

### Step 1: Comment on Their Posts
Before reaching out, engage genuinely with 3-5 of their posts.

**Good comments:**
- "This is spot-on. I see this with [related thing] all the time."
- "Love this perspective on [topic]."
- "[Specific insight] really resonates."

**Not:**
- "Great post!"
- "🔥🔥🔥"
- "Check out my services!"

---

### Step 2: Send Connection Request
```
Hi [Name] - Saw your post about [topic] and really related to [specific 
point]. Would love to connect!
```

---

### Step 3: Start Conversation (2-3 Days Later)
```
Thanks for connecting! 

I'm curious—what made you get into [their industry/role]?
```

**Build relationship FIRST. Mention services later.**

---

### Step 4: Natural Segue (Week+ Later)
```
By the way, I just opened up some brand photography availability. Not sure 
if that's on your radar, but thought I'd mention it since we've been chatting.

No pressure either way!
```

---

## TRACKING RESPONSES (So You Know What Works)

### Create Simple Spreadsheet:

| Contact Name | Method | Date Sent | Response? | Booked? |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Jane Smith   | Email  | Nov 18    | Yes       | Call scheduled |
| Bob Jones    | LinkedIn | Nov 18  | No        | -       |

**After 2 weeks, you'll see:**
- Which method works best for YOU
- What message style gets responses
- Who to follow up with

---

## YOUR PERSONALIZED APPROACH

**Based on your brand voice (authentic, not sales-y):**

### Week 1:
- Send newsletter to full list (use template above)
- Send 5 individual emails to warmest leads
- Comment on 10 LinkedIn posts (engagement, not pitching)

### Week 2:
- Follow up on anyone who responded to newsletter
- Send 5 more individual emails
- Send 3 LinkedIn messages to connections

### Week 3:
- Follow up on pending conversations
- Send another 5 individual emails
- Post availability on social media

**Goal:** 50 touchpoints in 3 weeks = 5-10 consultation calls = 1-3 bookings

---

## FINAL MINDSET

**You're not selling photography. You're offering transformation.**

Bad approach:
"I take photos. Want to hire me?"

Your approach:
"I help businesses show up as themselves. Authentically. Without the 
stock-photo feel. If that resonates, let's chat."

**That's your brand voice. That's how you reach out.**

---

## TEMPLATES SUMMARY

**Choose based on your comfort level:**

1. **Newsletter** - Send to many, lowest pressure
2. **Individual warm emails** - Personal, higher response rate
3. **LinkedIn messages** - Conversational, builds relationships
4. **Social posts** - Passive, reaches people who follow you

**Start with whatever feels LEAST awkward.**

**Then do it 50 times.**

**You'll get better at it. Promise.**
