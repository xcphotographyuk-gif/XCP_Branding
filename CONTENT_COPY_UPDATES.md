## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Key Messaging Principles
1. **Always "you/your"** - Never "we/I" unless absolutely necessary
2. **Focus on their transformation** - Not on the service itself
3. **Emphasize connection with their audience** - That's what they care about
4. **Use emotional triggers** - "authentic," "resonate," "connect," "elevate"
5. **Create urgency through value** - Not through scarcity
6. **End with clear CTAs** - Always guide to the form

### Tone Guidelines
- **Confident but not arrogant**
- **Empowering, not prescriptive**
- **Warm but professional**
- **Focused on outcomes, not process**
