## PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY

**If you need more images for certain pages:**

1. **Stock Photography** (use sparingly, must match your style):
   - Adobe Stock (free with Adobe Express)
   - Unsplash (free, high-quality)
   - Pexels (free)
   - Search: "luxury wedding," "business branding session," "photography workshop"

2. **Graphic Elements Instead:**
   - Icons for services
   - Typography-focused pages
   - Color blocks and geometric shapes
   - More white space = more luxury

3. **Repeat Strategic Images:**
   - HDV_Wall-1.jpg can appear 2-3 times (different crops)
   - City Spirit images are your hero content - use liberally
   - Travel photos work for multiple contexts

---

## IMAGE OPTIMIZATION BEFORE UPLOAD

**For Best Results:**

1. **Resolution:** Minimum 1920px on longest side for full-page images
2. **File Format:** JPG for photographs (smaller file size)
3. **Color Space:** sRGB for digital/screen viewing
4. **File Size:** Under 5MB per image (compress if needed at tinypng.com)
5. **Naming:** Use clear names (easier to find in Adobe Express)

---

## ADOBE EXPRESS IMAGE WORKFLOW

1. **Upload all images** to Adobe Express library first
2. **Drag and drop** into layout placeholders
3. **Use "Replace Image"** function to swap placeholders
4. **Crop/Reframe** using Adobe Express built-in tools
5. **Apply Effects** sparingly - keep images true to your style
6. **Adjust Opacity** if using images as backgrounds (60-80%)
7. **Add Overlays** (dark or light) for text readability if needed
