# For People-People Who Are Nervous About Digital Contact
## Social Media & Outreach Guide for Natural Connectors

**Your Superpower:** You're great with people face-to-face.  
**Your Challenge:** Initiating contact online feels awkward.  
**Your Need:** Relevant content that doesn't feel forced.

**Solution:** Leverage your people skills, minimize the scary parts.

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

**You're not bad at outreach. You're good at REAL connection.**

The nervousness you feel? That's because digital contact feels fake compared to real conversation.

**So we make it feel real.**

---

## STRATEGY: IN-PERSON FIRST, DIGITAL SECOND

### Your Natural Advantage

You're a **connector**. You build relationships naturally when you're with people.

**Use that.**

### The New Approach:

**Instead of cold digital outreach → Focus on real-world connection**

1. ✅ Go where your clients are (in person)
2. ✅ Have real conversations
3. ✅ Get permission to follow up
4. ✅ Then use email/social as continuation, not initiation

---

## WHERE TO MEET PEOPLE (Your Actual Strategy)

### Option 1: Business Networking Events

**Find local events:**
- Chamber of Commerce meetings
- BNI (Business Network International)
- Industry-specific meetups
- Coworking space events
- Business breakfast clubs

**Your approach:**
1. Show up (hardest part, you've got this)
2. Listen to what people do
3. When appropriate: "That's interesting. I work with [their industry] on brand photography. How do you currently handle your visual content?"
4. Have conversation (your strength!)
5. End with: "Would you be open to me sending you some examples of my work? Just email, no pressure."
6. Get their business card or email
7. **Follow up the NEXT DAY** (while conversation is fresh)

**Email template (day after meeting):**
```
Subject: Great meeting you yesterday!

Hi [Name],

Really enjoyed our conversation at [event] yesterday. Your approach to 
[thing they mentioned] is spot-on.

You mentioned you're [challenge they have]. I work with [their industry] 
businesses on brand photography specifically to solve that.

Here's my portfolio: [link]

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to chat about how professional 
imagery could help with [their specific challenge]?

Either way, great connecting with you.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Phone] - Feel free to call/text
```

**Why this works for you:**
- Email is continuation of REAL conversation
- Not cold outreach (you met them!)
- Reference specific things they said (shows you listened)
- Feels natural because it IS natural

---

### Option 2: Existing Social Settings

**You probably already do these:**
- Kids' school events (meet other parents)
- Gym/fitness classes
- Church/community groups
- Hobbies/clubs
- Volunteering

**New mindset:** These aren't just social—they're business opportunities.

**How to mention what you do:**

When someone asks "What do you do?"

**Instead of:** "I'm a photographer"

**Say:** "I help businesses show up authentically through brand photography. 
Basically, I make sure their photos actually look like them, not stock images."

**Then listen for:** "Oh, we actually need that..."

**Then:** "Would you like my card? Happy to chat about it anytime."

---

### Option 3: Strategic Volunteering

**Offer free photography for:**
- Local charity events
- Business awards ceremonies
- Community festivals
- Non-profit galas

**What you get:**
- Portfolio content
- Meet business owners (attendees)
- Business cards from 50+ people
- Credibility ("I'm shooting the gala")
- Permission to follow up

**Follow-up email:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great meeting you at [event]! I was the photographer (you might have seen 
me with the camera 😊).

Here are a few shots from the evening: [link to small gallery]

I noticed you mentioned [their business]. Do you currently have professional 
brand photography for [their company]?

Happy to chat if that's something you're thinking about.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY (For People Who Hate Posting)

### Core Rule: POST LESS, POST BETTER

**You don't need to post daily. You need to post RELEVANTLY.**

**Frequency:**
- Instagram/Facebook: 2-3 times per WEEK (not daily)
- LinkedIn: 1-2 times per WEEK
- Stories: When you have something real to share

**That's it. Not overwhelming.**

---

### WHAT TO POST (Only Relevant Content)

### Type 1: Behind-the-Scenes (No Pressure)

**Just share what you're doing:**

```
**Instagram Caption:**

On location today with [Client Industry - "a local startup" / "creative agency"].

Capturing their team in their actual workspace. No stiff poses. No fake smiles. 
Just them being them.

That's the goal: Look like yourself, just... professionally captured.

[1-2 photos from shoot - even iPhone behind-scenes shots work]

---

**LinkedIn Version:**

Just wrapped a brand photography session with [industry] business.

Three things I always tell clients:
1. Don't "pose"—just do what you normally do
2. Your best photos happen when you forget the camera exists
3. Professional doesn't mean stiff

The businesses that connect with their audience? They look like themselves.

[Photo from shoot]
```

**Why this works:**
- You're literally just describing your day
- No "selling"
- Shows expertise without bragging
- Easy to write (just say what happened)

**Frequency:** Post this whenever you have a shoot (1-2x/week naturally)

---

### Type 2: Client Results (With Permission)

**Post after delivering images:**

```
**Instagram:**

[Client name]'s new brand photos just went live on their website.

Swipe to see the before (generic stock photos) → after (actually them).

The difference isn't the camera. It's showing up as yourself.

If your brand photos feel like they're from someone else's business, 
let's fix that.

[Link in bio to book]

---

**LinkedIn:**

Helped [Company Name] update their visual brand this month.

Before: Stock photos that could be any business
After: Images that are distinctly THEM

The shift wasn't just visual—their website conversions increased 30% in 
the first month.

Professional imagery isn't vanity. It's strategy.

Need to update yours? [Calendly link in comments]
```

**Frequency:** After each project (1-2x/month)

---

### Type 3: Quick Tips (Easy to Create)

**Share ONE tip:**

```
**Instagram:**

Quick tip: Your profile photo should be less than 2 years old.

Why? Because people want to recognize you when they meet you.

If your photo is from 2019 (pre-pandemic hair, different vibe, old company), 
it's time to update it.

Your headshot should look like you TODAY.

Need an updated one? DM me.

---

**LinkedIn:**

Unpopular opinion: You don't need 50 photos from your brand session.

You need 12 GREAT ones that you'll actually use.

More isn't better. Better is better.

(And yes, I still deliver 50+ images. But most businesses use the same 12 
everywhere.)

Quality > quantity. Always.
```

**Frequency:** 1x per week

---

### Type 4: Availability Announcements (Direct)

**When you have space:**

```
**Instagram/Facebook:**

Taking on 2 new brand photography clients in [Month].

If you've been putting off updating your:
• Headshots
• Team photos
• Website imagery

Now's the time.

Investment starts at £800.

DM to chat or book a free call: [link in bio]

---

**LinkedIn:**

Opening up 3 photography sessions for [Month].

If your brand photos don't reflect who you are anymore (new team, new 
direction, outdated style), let's update them.

Sessions include strategy, shooting, and professionally edited images you 
can use everywhere.

Comment "interested" or DM me.
```

**Frequency:** 1x per month

---

## YOUR ACTUAL POSTING SCHEDULE (MINIMAL)

### Monday:
- **Post Type:** Behind-the-scenes from recent shoot
- **Time:** 15 minutes to write + post
- **Platforms:** Instagram + Facebook

### Wednesday:
- **Post Type:** Quick tip or insight
- **Time:** 10 minutes
- **Platform:** LinkedIn

### Friday:
- **Post Type:** Client result or availability
- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Platforms:** Instagram + Facebook + LinkedIn

**Total time:** 40 minutes per week, 3 posts

**That's manageable.**

---

## CONTENT TEMPLATES (COPY/PASTE READY)

### Monday - Behind-the-Scenes

**Template 1:**
```
Another day, another brand transforming their visual presence.

Today's shoot: [Industry] business finally getting photos that actually 
represent them.

No stock images. No stiff poses. Just authentic imagery that connects.

[Behind-scenes photo]
```

**Template 2:**
```
On location with [Client type].

Favorite part of my job? When clients relax and forget there's a camera.

That's when the magic happens.

[Photo]
```

**Template 3:**
```
Wrapped up a brand photography session today.

Client said: "I didn't realize photos could feel this natural."

That's the goal. Every time.

[Photo]
```

---

### Wednesday - Quick Tip

**Template 1:**
```
Your brand photos should answer one question:

"Why should I choose you?"

If they don't, they're just decoration.

Make them work harder.
```

**Template 2:**
```
Stop using the same photo everywhere.

LinkedIn: Professional headshot
Instagram: Lifestyle shot
Website about page: Environmental portrait
Email signature: Clear headshot

Same person, different contexts.
```

**Template 3:**
```
Biggest mistake I see with brand photography?

Businesses get amazing photos... then never use them.

Professional photos don't work if they stay on your hard drive.

Use them everywhere. That's what they're for.
```

---

### Friday - Client Result

**Template 1:**
```
[Client Name] just updated their website with new brand photos.

Traffic is up. Inquiries are up. Conversion is up.

Because people connect with authentic imagery.

Need to update yours? Link in bio.
```

**Template 2:**
```
Before: Generic stock photos
After: Actually them

The shift happened in one session.

Your brand photos should look like your brand.

DM if you're ready to update.
```

**Template 3:**
```
Just delivered photos to [Client Type].

Their response: "These finally feel like US."

That's what professional brand photography should do.

```

## HANDLING THE NERVES

### Before You Post:

**Reminder:**
- You're not bragging, you're informing
- People WANT to know you're available
- Someone needs exactly what you offer RIGHT NOW
- Not posting means they'll never know

**Mantra:**
"I'm helping, not selling."

---

### When You're Nervous About Hitting "Post":

**Ask yourself:**
- Would I want to know this if I needed a photographer?
- Am I being helpful or pushy?
- Does this sound like me?

**If yes to all three → Post it.**

---

### After You Post:

**Don't:**
- Refresh constantly checking engagement
- Delete it if it doesn't get immediate likes
- Compare to others' posts
- Overthink it

**Do:**
- Post and forget for 24 hours
- Respond to comments when they come
- Focus on next task
- Remember: Low engagement ≠ failure (you only need 1-2 clients to see it)

---

## SOCIAL MEDIA MINDSET SHIFT

**Old mindset:**
"I need to post perfectly polished content daily."

**New mindset:**
"I'll share what's relevant when I have something worth sharing."

**Result:**
- Less pressure
- More authentic
- Better content
- Sustainable long-term

---

## REPLYING TO COMMENTS/DMs

### When Someone Comments:

**Simple responses:**
- "Thanks! It was a great session."
- "Appreciate that!"
- "Would love to work with you sometime. DM me!"

**Don't overthink responses.**

---

### When Someone DMs About Booking:

**Template:**
```
Thanks for reaching out!

Quick question: What type of photography do you need? (headshots, team, 
brand content, etc.)

Happy to jump on a quick call if that's easier. Here's my calendar: [link]
```

**Then if they respond, move to phone/video call ASAP.**

**You're good with people. Get them on a call where you shine.**

---

---

## CONTENT BATCHING (For When You're Motivated)

### Spend 1 Hour Creating Month of Content:

**Write these out in advance:**
- 8 behind-the-scenes captions (2/week)
- 4 quick tips (1/week)
- 4 availability/result posts (1/week)

**Save in Notes app or Google Doc**

**Then every Monday/Wednesday/Friday:**
- Copy/paste saved caption
- Add photo
- Post
- Done in 5 minutes

**Removes decision fatigue.**

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**You DON'T need:**
- 10,000 followers
- Viral posts
- Daily stories
- Perfect aesthetic grid

**You DO need:**
- 50+ people who know you're available
- 5-10 consultation calls per month
- 1-3 bookings from those calls

**Your in-person skills close deals. Digital just opens doors.**

---

## EMERGENCY: "I'M TOO NERVOUS TO POST"

**Do this instead:**

### Option 1: Stories Only (24hr disappears)
Post to Instagram/Facebook stories instead of feed.

**Why it helps:**
- Disappears in 24 hours (less permanent)
- More casual (lower pressure)
- Still reaches people
- Practice with lower stakes

**Post:**
- Behind-the-scenes during shoot
- "Taking on clients for [Month]" announcement
- Quick tips
- Links to portfolio/booking

---

### Option 2: Private Messages Only
Skip public posts entirely.

**Send DM to:**
- People who engaged with past posts
- People you've met at events
- Past clients

**Message:**
```
Hey! Quick question—do you know anyone who might need brand photography 
in [Month]? I have a few spots opening up.

Thanks!
```

**Lower pressure than public post.**

---

### Option 3: Delegate Posting
Find someone to post FOR you.

**Options:**
- VA (Virtual Assistant) - £10-15/hour
- Social media manager - £200-300/month
- Friend who's good at social - Trade services

**You provide:**
- Photos
- Info about what you're offering
- Voice guidelines

**They handle:**
- Writing captions
- Posting
- Responding to comments (or flag for you)

**You focus on:**
- In-person networking (your strength)
- Client calls
- Actual photography

---

## YOUR PERSONALIZED STRATEGY

**Based on: Good with people, nervous about digital contact**

### Primary Focus: IN-PERSON
- Attend 1 networking event per week
- Meet 10 new people per month
- Get 10 business cards
- Follow up via email (they know you now!)

### Secondary Focus: MINIMAL SOCIAL
- Post 2-3x per week (pre-written templates)
- Focus on LinkedIn (professional, less personal pressure)
- Use Stories when nervous about permanent posts

### Tertiary Focus: EMAIL
- Newsletter once per month (to people you've met)
- Individual emails after networking
- Follow-ups on inquiries

**Let your people skills do the heavy lifting.**

**Use digital as support, not primary strategy.**

---

## REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

### Month 1:
- Attend 4 networking events = Meet 40 people
- Post 8-12 times on social
- Send 40 follow-up emails
- Get 5-10 consultation calls
- Book 1-3 clients

**Revenue:** £800-£5,400

### Month 3:
- Met 120+ people through events
- Have 500+ social media reach
- Built email list of 100+
- Getting 10-20 consultation calls/month
- Booking 3-5 clients/month

**Revenue:** £2,400-£17,500

**Your in-person skills accelerate this.**

---

## FINAL PEP TALK

**You're nervous about digital contact because it feels less authentic than real conversation.**

**That's actually a GOOD thing.**

**It means you value real connection.**

**So lean into that:**
- Meet people face-to-face (your superpower)
- Use digital as follow-up (easier)
- Post minimally but consistently (manageable)
- Let your natural people skills close deals

**You don't need to become a social media expert.**

**You need to be YOU—just visible enough online for people to find you.**

**3 posts per week + 1 networking event = More than enough.**

**You've got this. 🎯**

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. [ ] Find ONE networking event this week (Google: "[your city] business networking")
2. [ ] Order business cards (if you don't have them)
3. [ ] Write 3 social media captions (save for this week)
4. [ ] Post ONCE this week (just one, as practice)
5. [ ] Go to networking event
6. [ ] Email everyone you met

**Start with what feels least scary.**

**Build from there.**

**The confidence comes from doing it, not from feeling ready.**
