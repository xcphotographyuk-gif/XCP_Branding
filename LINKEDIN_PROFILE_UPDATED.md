## ABOUT SECTION (Client-Benefit Focused with AIDA Structure)

```
Your brand deserves more than stock photos and staged smiles.

Think about the last time an image stopped your scroll. Not because it was perfect, but because it felt real. That's what your customers are craving. That's what builds trust before they ever reach out.

Whether your team needs authentic brand imagery that reflects your culture, or your workspace walls are crying out for fine art that tells your story, professional photography isn't just about looking good. It's about being remembered.

📸 SERVICES THAT ELEVATE YOUR BRAND:
• Brand Photography Sessions (from £1,495) - headshots, team culture, office environments that capture who you really are
• Documentary-Style Business Photography - behind-the-scenes storytelling that connects with your audience
• Live Event & Performance Coverage - authentic moments from conferences, launches, and corporate events
• Professional Headshots & Portraits - confidence-building imagery for individuals and teams
• Workshops, Retreats & Photography Courses - learn to see your brand through a new lens
• Fine Art & Wall Art for Your Space - museum-quality prints that transform offices, hotels, and homes into branded experiences

🎯 YOUR RESULTS:
• Stand out in crowded newsfeeds with imagery that stops the scroll
• Build trust with authentic visuals that reflect your real culture
• Create 6-12 months of social content from a single session
• Transform bland office walls into conversation-starting brand statements
• Own your visual narrative instead of relying on generic stock photos

💡 THE ROI OF REAL IMAGERY:
When potential clients land on your website or LinkedIn, your visuals speak first. Generic photos say "we're like everyone else." Authentic brand photography says "we're worth paying attention to." The difference shows in engagement rates, conversion rates, and how long people stay on your pages.

Fine art for your workspace isn't decoration. It's identity. It tells clients, employees, and partners what you value the moment they walk through the door. From corporate offices to hotel collections, curated imagery shapes how people feel about your space.

Serving clients across the UK and internationally from Brighton. Available for on-location shoots, multi-day projects, and custom commissions.
