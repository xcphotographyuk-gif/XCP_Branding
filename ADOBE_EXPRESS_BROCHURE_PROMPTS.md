## TROUBLESHOOTING

**AI generates wrong style?**
→ Add more specific keywords: "minimalist," "luxury," "sophisticated," "black and white aesthetic"

**Images don't fit well?**
→ Use Adobe Express crop and resize tools; adjust image opacity if using as background

**Text hard to read over images?**
→ Add dark overlay (30-60% black) behind text or use text box with solid background

**Layout feels cluttered?**
→ Remove elements; embrace white space; increase margins; reduce text amount

**Need help?**
→ Adobe Express has tutorials at express.adobe.com/learn
