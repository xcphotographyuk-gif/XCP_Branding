---

## Legal & Tax Considerations (UK)

### VAT:
- Register for VAT if turnover > £85,000/year
- Most POD suppliers handle VAT on products
- You charge VAT on final sale price (if registered)

### Product Liability:
- POD suppliers typically cover this
- Ensure contracts specify liability
- Consider business insurance

### Returns & Refunds:
- UK law: 14-day return right for online purchases
- POD suppliers have return policies
- You decide your policy (recommend matching supplier's)

### Consumer Rights:
- Products must match description
- Quality must be acceptable
- Customers can return faulty items

**Recommendation:** Clear returns policy on your site + business insurance (£10-30/month)

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Formula:
**Retail Price = (Base Cost × 2.5-3) + Shipping Buffer**

**Example:**
- Canvas 16x20" base cost: £18 (Printful)
- Multiply by 2.5: £45
- Add shipping buffer: +£5
- **Retail price: £50**

### Factors:
- Quality tier (premium can go 3-4× base)
- Market research (what competitors charge)
- Your brand positioning
- Product exclusivity (limited editions = higher)

**Don't compete on price. Compete on quality and story.**

---
