## CAPTION FORMULAS (Your Voice)

### Formula 1: Story → Insight → CTA
```
[Opening hook - story]

The truth is, [insight that challenges assumptions].

[Personal perspective or experience]

[Value statement]

[Soft CTA]

---
What's your take? Drop it below 👇
```

**Example:**
```
Shot this brand session yesterday and something clicked.

The truth is, the best photos happen when people stop trying to look "professional" and just... exist.

I spent 15 years chasing technical perfection. Light. Composition. Sharpness.

But the shots that book clients? They're the ones where you see the PERSON.

Your ideal clients aren't looking for polish. They're looking for connection.

---
What makes you stop scrolling—perfect photos or real moments? 👇
```

---

### Formula 2: Challenge → Reality → Solution
```
[Question or challenge]

Here's what actually happens: [reality check]

[Your perspective]

[How you solve it]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
"Do I really need professional photos?"

Here's what actually happens:

You launch with DIY shots. They're... fine.
But you never LOVE them. You hesitate to share them.
Your About page feels weak.

I've seen it 100 times.

Professional imagery isn't about vanity. It's about confidence.

When you have photos you're proud of, you show up differently. You post more. You pitch bigger.

That's the ROI.

### Formula 3: Behind-the-Scenes Truth
```
[BTS moment]

[What people don't see]

[Your perspective on craft]

[Lesson or takeaway]
```

**Example:**
```
This shot took 47 tries.

Not because the client couldn't smile. Because I was waiting for REAL.

That moment when they stopped performing and just existed.

Photography isn't about capturing what you see.
It's about capturing what you FEEL.

And feeling can't be faked.
