## 🔒 Privacy Features

### Why Privacy Mode?

Many photographers are concerned about their images being used to train AI systems. This plugin addresses those concerns:

1. **No Image Upload** - In Privacy Mode, actual image data NEVER leaves your computer
2. **Metadata-Only Analysis** - Content is generated from EXIF, keywords, collections, and filename patterns
3. **Template-Based** - Professional templates ensure quality without AI image analysis
4. **Local AI Option** - Use Ollama locally for AI assistance without cloud services

### What Metadata is Used?

In Privacy Mode, the plugin analyzes:
- Existing keywords and collections
- EXIF data (camera, lens, settings)
- GPS/Location information
- Filename patterns
- File type and dimensions

**NOT analyzed**: The actual image pixels

- Consider using Privacy Mode which doesn't need image processing

### AI features not working
1. Check API key is configured (OpenAI) or Ollama is running (local)
2. Test connection in Plugin Manager settings
3. Check Lightroom logs for error details

### Content not appearing in metadata
- Check the IPTC Instructions field contains platform content
- Ensure write access to catalog wasn't cancelled
- Verify photos are selected before running preparation
